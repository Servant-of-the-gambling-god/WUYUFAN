This is a Tetris game. You can choose four difficulty in the user interface, it includes "easy", "middle", "hard" and "hell"(very hard). 

You can operate the dropping block by pressing "↓", "←", "→" and "space" on the keyboard, and press "⭡" to rotate the block, and "c" to save the block, if it already 

exists a block has been saved, the current block is changed to the saved block, and "c" can be used one time in a round with a block appearing and being put down.

The block appears on the topmost of the map and drop down naturally. Press "↓" to make block drop down faster, and press "space" to put down the block directly. Press "←", 

"→" to control its fall-down position.



Basic part

Based on the rule we mentioned above, we rises up the line by adding a new line of block on the bottom with a "BB" block in some conditions. You can only eliminate that line by 

dropped a block on the "BB" block.



Middle part

Based on the Basic part, we give you an additional benefit. If there has a spare square in the bottommost layer. A "JJ" block will be put to fill up that line, and when after 

you dropped down the current block. The "JJ" line will be eliminated as the normal lines.



Hard part

Based on the Basic part, but that will rise up the line faster and harder than the Basic part.



Very hard part

Based on the Hard part, but that will rise up the line faster and harder than the Hard part. Even the game producer can eliminate less than 10 lines. Poor Game experience make you annoyed. Have fun, and have a nice day.
